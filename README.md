**Course description**

In this course, you will learn popular machine learning algorithms, principal component analysis, and regularization by building a movie recommendation system.

You will learn about training data, and how to use a set of data to discover potentially predictive relationships. As you build the movie recommendation system, you will learn how to train algorithms using training data so you can predict the outcome for future datasets. You will also learn about overtraining and techniques to avoid it such as cross-validation. All of these skills are fundamental to machine learning.

- [Probability and Statistics](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorial): The most crucial aspect of data science is based on mathematical fundamentals like statistics, probability, and linear algebra.
- [Business Intelligence](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-business-intelligence-article): You will be in charge of making decisions at different labels, so you should be knowledgeable about the most recent BI tools.
- [Programming Languages](https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article): The most efficient and potent programming languages for data science are thought to be [**Python**](https://www.simplilearn.com/learn-the-basics-of-python-article) **and** [**R.**](https://www.simplilearn.com/how-to-learn-r-programming-article)
- [Machine Learning](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/what-is-machine-learning): Some of the main ML algorithms you should concentrate on are regression approaches, the Naive Bayes algorithm, and regression trees.
- Data Manipulation: When it comes to understanding your data sets, data manipulation and [data visualization](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-visualization-article) become essential.
- [**Machine learning**](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/what-is-machine-learning) can be defined as the practice of using algorithms to extract data, learn from it, and then forecast future trends for that topic. Traditional machine learning software is [statistical analysis](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-statistical-analysis-article) and predictive analysis that is used to spot patterns and catch hidden insights based on perceived data.
